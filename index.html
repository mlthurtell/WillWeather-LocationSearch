<title>WillyWeather - Location ID Search</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>WillyWeather Location Search Page</h1><br>
<h2>Last Updated: 25 September 2024</h2><br>
- Updated CORS Proxy<br>
- Removed API textbox as the app is now <b>PAID</b> and this is included in the price<br>
- Updated 'help' for people with issues loading<br>
- Tested page fully working<br>
<br>
<p>Use this page to search the WillyWeather database for locations. Find the location you are after using the information provided in the table, and enter your location's <b>Location ID</b> from the table below into your location banks in the Garmin/Connect IQ <i>OzTides</i> application, available <a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/a3d9959a-4e18-4443-8663-f1a6087c3ab9">here</a>. <br>
<br> 
If you're having issues, this page relies on a third party service CORS proxy (out of my control) to format HTML headers, which may be down. If it is broken, please drop me an email or let me know through the contact developer link on the Garmin App page. If you are able to fix this issue permanently by providing a proxy, please let me know, it'd be much appreciated.

<h1>Help and General Info</h1><br>
<h5>Payment</h5>
Iâ€™ve made the decision to move this app from a free model to a paid one to provide a more seamless and reliable experience for users. I offer a no-holds barred, 24 hour trial of the app during which time you ahave access to all functionality.<br>
This change helps me to address common issues such as obtaining a WillyWeather API key and streamline the overall setup process as I was spending tonnes of time helping people out.<br>
<br>
This app uses KiezelPay for payment processing, a well-known service in the Garmin and Fitbit community. It is secure, PCI-compliant and is pretty quick and painless. Certainly less painless than obtaining a WillyWeather API Key.<br> 
If you're not keen on using this, please contact me directly and we can work something out.<br>
<br>
<h5>Graphing</h5>
Graphing is based on the estimated tide height. There are plans in the works to show tidal progression via time as well.<br>
<br>
<h5>Rule of Twelfths</body></h5>
As of V3.0.0, watches with more screen real estate will now give tidal estimates based on the "Rule of Twelfths". This is exactly as it sounds - an estimate. See <i>Wikipedia: Rule of Twelfths</i> for more info <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_twelfths#Tides">here</a><br>
- The rule is a rough approximation only and should be applied with great caution when used for navigational purposes. Officially produced tide tables should be used in preference whenever possible.<br>
- The rule assumes that all tides behave in a regular manner, this is not true of some geographical locations.<br>
- The rule assumes that the period between high and low tides is six hours but this is an underestimate and can vary anyway<br>
<br>
<h5>To Do</h5>
- Add graphing mode based on time<br>
- On start-up, search for today's tide in the cache and display it automatically<br>
<br>
<h5>Requests</h5>
